## Prerequisites

- Polish Input Source added in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources

## Configuration
1. Place the ```Pol-Jap.keylayout``` in ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts```
2. Logoff, logon
3. System Preferences -> Input Sources -> + -> Others -> Pol-Jap

## Remarks
If ```Pol-Jap.keylayout``` is saved to ```~/Library/Keyboard Layouts``` user can select it, but upon screen lock, it gets switched to different layout and does not come back after unlocking.

The layout was created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)
