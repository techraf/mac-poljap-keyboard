Polish (Programmers) Keyboard Layout for use with Japanese MacBooks

## Prerequisites
- [Google Japanese Input](https://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/ime/) (Google IME); also available from Homebrew Cask ```google-japanese-ime```
- Polish Input Source added in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources

## Configuration
Place the ```Pol-Jap.keylayout``` in ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts```

## Remarks
If ```Pol-Jap.keylayout``` is saved to ```~/Library/Keyboard Layouts``` user can select it, but upon screen lock, it gets switched to different layout and does not come back after unlocking.

The layout was created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)
